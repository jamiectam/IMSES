It is likely that future climate conditions will reduce prey availability, where studies have shown that adequate food abundance can buffer some of the effects of climate change. Future diet limitations increases female adult aggression (impact on mating success?), delays embryo development (later hatching) and decreased molting success. These factors will potentially affect population size. Multiple global change drivers will interact to alter lobster environments. Interactive effects of temperature, acidification and diet will heighten individual stressor impacts on lobster population abundance.",,1

Lobster size at maturity,lobster stock productivity and abundance,,-,,"Size at maturity should be lower than minimum legal size

If size at maturity is high, lobsters are larger when they can reproduce, and if fished below the MLS they won't get a chance to reproduce and will have negative impacts on overall lobster stock productivity and abundance. 

If size at maturity is decreasing below MLS, this should have a positive impact on lobster stock productivity and abundance as they will reach maturity and have a chance to reproduce before they are caught.

Size of maturity (SoM) is required to determine the proportion of mature females in a population, to estimate reproductive potential and to support decisions on minimum legal size (MLS). Overtime the SOM can change, often driven by temperature or potentially fishing pressure (Landers et al. 2001, Little et al. 2005, Pugh et al. 2013, Gaudette et al. 2014, Haar et al. 2017, LeBris et al. 2017). With ocean temperatures rising, the SoM of female lobster throughout their range could be decreasing (Waller at al. 2019). Without a clear understanding of what changes are taking place, it is difficult to estimate what impact fisheries decisions and fishing pressure has on a population. Stock assessment models for the Maritimes currently rely on SoM estimates calculated between 1989-2011 depending on the area (Pezzack and Duggan 1989, Little and Watson 2005, Reeves et al. 2011). To provide accurate advice, updated estimates are necessary to adapt to changing ecosystems. These estimates can vary dramatically throughout the range of American Lobster so extensive coverage throughout the Maritimes is required to acquire relevant data for the stock units (LFAs).",Medium,1
